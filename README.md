# MineSweeper

An implementation of the classic game, Mine Sweeper. It follows the classic rules of a grid that has a certain number of bombs, and the user needs to identify all of the good squares and not run into any bombs. 

Users can mark the squares as a safe square, if they are not sure if a particular square is a bomb, and denote that a square is a bomb. As bombs are found, the user is notified in the UI. After the game finishes, the users can choose to play again and can specify the size of the board.
